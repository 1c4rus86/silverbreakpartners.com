    <h1>Preserving Legacy. Unlocking Possibility.</h1>
    <p>
      SilverBreak Partners is a group of investors dedicated to preserving and evolving the legacy of small to mid-sized businesses. We invest in exceptional companies with strong foundations — guiding them into their next chapter with strategic support, operational insight, and long-term capital. Our mission is to honor what’s been built while unlocking what’s possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team consists of three experienced executives who met during their MBA at Wharton. Collectively, we bring a cross-functional background in strategy, operations, and leadership, with experience at leading firms such as McKinsey & Company, Amazon, Bain & Company, and Fortune 500 corporations in the technology and healthcare sectors. This diverse perspective enables us to approach acquisitions with both analytical rigor and a deep appreciation for the operational realities of running and scaling a business.
